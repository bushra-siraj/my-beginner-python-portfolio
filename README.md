# 🌟 My First Steps in Coding: Foundational Python Projects

This repository showcases my very **first attempts at programming** and building fundamental logic. Each project is a small, console-based application originally developed as I began my journey into data science.

This collection represents the **foundational coding skills** I acquired before moving on to more complex analysis.

## 💻 Accessing the Projects: The Single Notebook

Since these are my initial, foundational coding steps, all the projects (like the Vending Machine and BMI Calculator) are contained within a **single Google Colab Notebook file**.

### How to View the Code

1.  **Click the File:** Simply click on the file named **`data-science-beginner-projects.ipynb`** in the file list above.
2.  **View the Projects:** GitHub will open and display the notebook. Each small project is clearly separated by a **heading** within that single file, making it easy to see where one project ends and the next begins.

### 💡 Project Overview

These simple programs demonstrate core concepts like user input, conditional logic, loops, and function use.

| Concept Covered | Project Example | Key Skills Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic & Flow** | Vending Machine Program, Quiz App Concept | `If/Else` statements, function calls, state changes. |
| **Data Handling** | Student Info System, Expense Logger | Basic data storage, retrieval, and list manipulation. |
| **Calculations** | BMI Calculator, Bank Account Simulator | Mathematical operations, variable manipulation. |
| **Interactivity** | To-Do List Concept, Number Guessing Game | Input handling, iterative improvement (`While` loops). |

### 🚀 Data Scientist & Video Editor Background

As a **Data Scientist** and **Video Editor**, I merge a background in **creative narrative** and **visual storytelling** with my passion for **data logic** and **Data analysis**. This helps me not only analyze trends but also structure complex data into clear, compelling insights.
